# Lab08BST
Lab in CS 235 in which we create and manage binary search trees using a templated class.
"A binary search tree (BST), which may sometimes be called an ordered or sorted binary tree, is a node-based data structure where each node references a value, a left child, and a right child.

In a Binary Search Tree, the left subtree of a node contains only nodes with values less than the node's value, the right subtree of a node contains only nodes with values greater than the node's value, there are no duplicate nodes, and both left and right subtrees of a node must also be binary search trees."
